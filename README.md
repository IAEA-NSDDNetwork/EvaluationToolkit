Test version

This toolkit basically combines all ENSDF Java codes and some common tools in one application. The functions of each individual code included in this toolkit are the same as those in the corresponding stand-alone code in the NSDD Github, except for possible version difference of the individual code.

How it works:
1.	Load input, either through the “load” button or dragging the files to the left side pane area. It will determine and select all relevant codes to be run for the input, as shown in the checkbox area. One can de-select any of those selected codes.
2.	Click “Run”. Once the run is completed, only the codes that have been run and only the relevant output files that are updated will be listed in a tree structure in the left side pane. One can then click on any file name to show its contents in one tabbed window in the main text area. Multiple files can be opened and displayed in different tabbed windows (right click to close all tabs). One can also drag any text file (not necessarily in the file list in the left pane) to this area to show its contents and use it like a text editor.

Note: all codes are run with default settings. To view/change settings or to run any individual code, double click on a code in the checkbox area to open that code and run it separately. 

Common tools:

Click on the “Other Tools” button to open a small window listing some common tools. A short description is given for each tool and click the tool name button to open the tool window where a simple instruction or examples for usage are added.
